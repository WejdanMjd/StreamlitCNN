# StreamlitCNN
A repository for storing and sharing machine learning models and image classification projects

# My AI Image Classification App

This is a project for image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project includes 3 different models: 


 **Model 1**
The **MobileNet model** achieves high accuracy (95% on training, 94% on validation and test sets), showcasing its effective learning and generalization capabilities through transfer learning.


**Model 2** 
We use the **ResNet model** in transfer learning to leverage pre-trained features, improving our modelâ€™s accuracy by adapting it to a new task with fewer data.

**Model 3**
The **CNN first model** achieves 67% accuracy
